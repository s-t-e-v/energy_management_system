  - Average consumption
  - Recent Highest consumption
- Import record data
  - .csv format
  - .txt format
- Authentication
- Registration
- Responsive interface
- Data collection
  - Data are collected from a database which is automatically generated by an energy record simulation program (24/7 running process)

## Stack

- NextJs, React
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap

### Back

- Python
- Django

A REST API is used to manage interaction between the frontend and backend.

## Install

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
